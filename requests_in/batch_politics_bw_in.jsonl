Every Month.' and body text'Service Fridays is a new initiative that will be led by Marla Valentin and myself, Paola Soler. We\u00a0are juniors, and this is our CAS project, which we are quite passionate about. First of all, it is a\u00a0very interesting initiative; Marla and I chose it because we enjoy volunteering at\u00a0various organizations. As a point of reference, for our eighth grade Community Service Project,\u00a0we spent the majority of our time in an orphanage with children between the ages of 3 and 9,\u00a0and this experience inspired us to design our CAS project.  In order to achieve\u00a0the best results and involve the Baldwin community, on the first Friday of every month we will\u00a0host a drive that is specific to the location we will visit that month. For example, in February,\u00a0we will host a book drive that will be announced to the entire school later this week, as we will\u00a0be volunteering at the San Juan Community Library. To give you guys a sneak peek, we will be\u00a0hosting a toy drive in March as we intend to visit the orphanage we visited in eighth\u00a0grade on a regular basis.',Is this article related to any social or political stances/ideas/topics at all?

Midnights is a sultry testament to the singer-songwriter\u2019s starlit life and her countless sleepless-nights, filled with lingering feelings of passion, loss, and solitude. Throughout the album\u2019s 13 tracks, Swift is the rawest we\u2019ve ever seen her. Her two latest albums, Folklore and Evermore, were a mix of personal and fictional tales, but Midnights is seemingly all her, and it is visually and sonically stunning, accompanied by imagery that perfectly encompass the album\u2019s distinct and nostalgic sound.  She\u2019s content with what her scheming has brought her and knows that it isn\u2019t out of malice, but because she truly cares, and those around her acknowledge it. Standout Lyric: \u201cWe were born to be the pawn in every lover\u2019s game\u2026Strategy sets the scene for the tale, I\u2019m the wind in our free-flowing sails\u201d\u00a0Midnights is quintessential Taylor Swift, combining many sounds and distinct production styles in order to create what appears to be one of the year\u2019s best (and highest performing) albums so far. Swift is blunt and unafraid of consequences, making this album one of her most honest and enjoyable to date.',Is this article related to any social or political stances/ideas/topics at all?

The religious meaning behind a hijab is that it is to be used as a veil or barrier to protect Muslim women from the eyes and lust of the outside world. Although this encounter is relatively common and happens quite often, what struck the public was her sudden death two days later (September 16th).  Staying informed can be the best way to use political power. Supporting the Iranian women within Puerto Rico can help bring greater attention to the cause. Following social media accounts that support the cause can help stay up to date on news and upcoming events. The instagram account Middle East Matters\u2019 has been strictly posting information on the protests, and where they have been held globally.

Last month, specifically the 16th of September, something similar occurred when the category 1 hurricane Fiona hit us. You may think that a category-1 hurricane is something pretty light, but still, on this island, where electricity is very unreliable and a lot of houses are surrounded by mountains or land that can easily slide, it was devastating.  We started by cleaning her floor, which was dirty from flood water, and I transitioned to cleaning her fridge by taking out all the stinky, expired food, whose smell took over her whole house and was affecting her health conditions.This was an excellent and fulfilling service activity since I had the opportunity not only to aid the community, but also to get out of our closed-knit community and see how the rest of the island is adapting to the new life conditions after the atmospheric phenomenon. While we were cleaning, we were mostly talking to the residents about their experience and trying to put ourselves in their shoes through these tough times. Overall, I would definitely do it again and advise people to help out as much as they can since it is an amazing life experience that you can learn from.',Is this article related to any social or political stances/ideas/topics at all?
